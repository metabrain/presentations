		<p>Focus for today</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Java (surprise..!)</li>
			<li>Kotlin </li>
			<li>Groovy</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Honorable mentions</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Scala</li>
			<li>Closure</li>
			<li>Ceylon</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Scala has too many features to list here and the problem space can be quite different - plus it's a very academic language.</p>
		<p>Closure does not improve on Java-esque syntax but rather replaces it with a completelly distinct one.</p>
		<p>Ceylon is not as used/matured as the other and quite honestly, I do not know much of it... Other than it has Union Types which is awesome!</p>

		<h3>Why focus on Kotlin</h3>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Small learning curve for Java devs compared to other JVM languages (Scala/Closure)</li>
			<li>A <emph>lot</emph> less verbose than Java - an order magnitude such as the jump between Java 8 and 5/6</li>
			<li>Share same JVM bytecode ecosystem - all Java libraries can be used in Kotlin, which some nuances</li>
			<li>Some AdCloud services as off late have been "accidentaly" written in Kotlin, so I have some experience using it. (yes, it is in production)</li>
		</ul>

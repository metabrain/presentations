presentations-service/ // nothing to merge

mim-service/ // really simple merge, just .gitignore changed in master

inventory-service/
// a bit of new logic brought in. Ignas requested to make merge. Did it myself and took changes from adbroker-free and ignored master since it was a kind of copy-paste to work in master as well

    EN-866 - Added a migration to create new organisation created events which link the content owner resource sets with the organisations

delivery-reporting-service/
// straight forward merge, mostly deps and gitignore

data-generator-app/
// normal merge, but 3/4 migrations done on each branch independently so now they have kind of the same numbers which makes it look a bit dodgy

content-service/
// by far, as expected the hardest merge. required fixing some tests and digging some deleted files from master branch. all tests passing now and should be good, but this needs extensive testing.

content-app/
//

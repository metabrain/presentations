On the subject of 'Null Safety'

* Java

	@NonNullable
	public T go(V param) {
		T result;
		if(param!=null) {
			result = param.method();
		} else {
			result = new T();
		}
		return result;
	}

	* Though luck - don't forget to check for possible null references - "requires" defensive programming. 

* Groovy (same, but with Elvis/safe-navigation operator)

	@NonNullable
	fun T go(V param) {
		var result = ref?.method()

		return result!=null ? result : new T()
	}

	* Elvis operator is simply syntatic-sugar for the "defensive java" version above. 

* Kotlin (first attempt!)

	fun go(param: V): T {
		val result: T = param?.method()
		return result
	}

	* T represents all possible _non-null_ values of class (or sub-classes/implementations) of T.
	* But this is not enough: in Kotlin, the implementation of V::method is required to know if this scenario type-checks!
		* When interoperating with another JVM language, every "language" border is considered unsafe - in other words, any method which comes from non-Kotlin JVM bytecode is considered null-prone.

		* Example in Java of V

			class V {
				T method() {
					// doesnt matter
				}
			}

			// Kotlin will only compile with 
			fun go(param: V): T {
				val result: T = param?.method() ?: new T() // we can't trust Java, so we need to use the default operator
				return result
			}

			* ?: is the 'default' operator in case the left-side expression evaluates to false

			// ...or, for the (very) brave..

			fun go(param: V): T {
				val result: T = param?.method()! //we can't trust Java... but you can trust me Mr. Type Checker
				return result
			}

			* ! is the "trust-me-i-know-the-jvm-interrop-border-is-null-safe-i-programmed-it-myself-many-moons-ago-i-swear" - all bets are off at this point. Yes, AT THIS POINT, if method() returns a null value, the runtime will throw a NPE. 

			* BONUS: Additionaly, if you want to propagate possible null values (there is not good "default" value for example), you can simply use T? which includes all T's plus the null value - even though in this scenario we want non-null Ts only as to emulate the examples in Groovy and Java.

			fun go(param: V): T? {
				val result: T? = param?.method()
				return result
			}
